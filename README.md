# Identifying-Commuter-Travel-Patterns-In-Bus-Services
A project I did with Land Transport Authority, a statutory board, whose main role is to manage the transportation infra of Singapore which includes public transport like bus and trains. The agency was interested to understand how the bus services were being utilized by commuters during peak hours and if interventions could be introduced to further enhance commuter experience on bus services e.g. shorter waiting time, faster trips with skipping of bus stops etc. This required understanding archetypes of travel patterns by commuters in bus services. This project is an extension of what was previously done here: https://blog.data.gov.sg/fingerprint-of-a-bus-route-73e5be53dcf0
